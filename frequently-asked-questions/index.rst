Do we need to report on the progress of our project?
=====================================================

Yes, I will frequently select a student project at random to report on their current state at the end of a lecture.

Why are the projects public?
============================

Transparency and reproducibility is a core value in research. Also, we want to learn from each other.

How can I initialize the repository for my student project?
===========================================================

Please just follow this invitation `link <https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/37739145-ose-data-science>`_.

Can we work in groups?

Yes, going forward from the iteration of the course for the summer term 2022, students are allowed to work in groups of two.

Do I get any extra credit for ensuring full reproducibility of my project using GitHub Actions?
===============================================================================================

Yes, everybody who successfully sets up a continuous integration workflow will get an extra bump in their grade.

Where can I look for publications that provide the data behind their research?
==============================================================================

Some journals provide the data for their published articles as data supplements directly on their website. In addition, the `Replication Wiki <http://replication.uni-goettingen.de/wiki/index.php/Main_Page>`_  and the `Harvard Dataverse <https://dataverse.harvard.edu>`_ compile a lot such information.

What are other useful resources for research data?
==================================================

There is a tremendous amount of data available online. For example, MDRC provides a host of data files for public use `here <https://www.mdrc.org/available-public-use-files>`_ from the evaluation of public policy initiatives. More generally, `Google Dataset Search <https://datasetsearch.research.google.com>`_ allows to look for all kinds of online data.

Do we get to present our projects at the end of the course?
============================================================

Yes, at the end of the lecture period we will host a "Demo Day", where selected projects will be presented to the whole class.
