Do we need to report on the progress of our project?
=====================================================

Yes. At the end of a lecture, I will frequently select a student at random to report on the current state of their project.

Why are the projects public?
============================

Transparency and reproducibility are core values in research. Also, we want to learn from each other.

How can I initialize the repository for my student project?
===========================================================

Please just follow this invitation `link <https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/37739145-ose-data-science>`_.

Can we work in groups?
======================

Yes, going forward from the iteration of the course for the summer term 2022, students are allowed to work in groups of two.

Do I get any extra credit for ensuring full reproducibility of my project using GitHub Actions?
===============================================================================================

Yes, everybody who successfully sets up a continuous integration workflow will get an extra bump in their grade.

Where can I look for publications that provide the data behind their research?
==============================================================================

Some journals provide the data for their published articles as data supplements directly on their website. In addition, the `Replication Wiki <http://replication.uni-goettingen.de/wiki/index.php/Main_Page>`_  and the `Harvard Dataverse <https://dataverse.harvard.edu>`_ compile a lot of such information.

What are other useful resources for research data?
==================================================

There is a tremendous amount of data available online. For example, MDRC provides a host of data files for public use `here <https://www.mdrc.org/available-public-use-files>`_ from the evaluation of public policy initiatives. The `UC Irvine machine learning repository <https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/>`_ also maintains several hundred datasets.  More generally, `Google Dataset Search <https://datasetsearch.research.google.com>`_ allows you to look for all kinds of online data.

A primer on finding data is available `here <https://sebastiantellotrillo.com/resources/primer-where-to-find-data>`_ on the personal website of `Prof. Sebastian Tello-Trillo <https://sebastiantellotrillo.com/>`_. 

Several textbooks provide an impressive amount of data from research articles. We provide them in a central place `online <https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/ose-course-projects/tree/newstruct_emily/datasets>`__.

We collect data from several textbooks.

* **Wooldridge, J. M. (2009)**. `Econometric analysis of cross section and panel data course projects documentation <https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/econometric-analysis-cross-section-and-panel-data>`__. Cambridge, MA: *The MIT Press*.

* **Angrist, J. D., and Pischke, J. (2014)**. `Mastering 'metrics <http://masteringmetrics.com>`__. Princeton, NJ: *Princeton University Press*.

Do we get to present our projects at the end of the course?
============================================================

Yes, at the end of the lecture period we will host a "Demo Day", where selected projects will be presented to the whole class.
