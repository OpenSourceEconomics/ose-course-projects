Replication Projects
====================

Here are some examples of replication projects from earlier iterations of the `OSE data science course <https://ose-data-science.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_.

--------------
Angrist (1990)
--------------

The randomly assigned risk of induction generated by the draft lottery is used to construct estimates of the effect of veteran status on civilian earnings. These estimates are not biased by the fact that certain types of men are more likely than others to service in  the military. Social Security administrative records indicate that in the early  1980s, long  after  their service  in  Vietnam was ended, the earnings of white veterans were approximately 15 percent less than the earnings of comparable nonveterans.

Lindo et al. (2010)
-------------------

Lindo et al. (2010) examine the effects of academic probation on student outcomes using a regression discontinuity design. The analysis is based on data from a large Canadian university and evaluates whether academic probation is successful in improving the performance of low scoring students. Consistent with a model of performance standards, the authors find that being placed on probation in the first year of university induces some students to drop out of school while it improves the grades of students who continue their studies. In a more general sense, academic probation can offer insights into how agents respond to negative incentives and the threat of punishment in a real-world context.

Collaboration Projects
======================

An example of a collaboration project from a previous iteration of the `OSE data science course <https://ose-data-science.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ is also available below.    

----------
Daimler AG 
----------

The main focus of this project is to develop a procedure to identify abnormal observations in sensor data collected during production processes. Each data point can be interpreted as a set of points where a function was observed. Therefore, the whole problem can be approached from a standpoint of outlier classification in functional data.
