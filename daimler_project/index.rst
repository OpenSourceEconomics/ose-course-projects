OSE Data Science Project in Cooperation with Daimler AG
-------------------------------------------------------

Instead of replicating the core results of an empirical paper, one student also has the opportunity to work 
on a course project in cooperation with Daimler AG and get first-hand experience in applied data science.

What is the project about? 
==========================

The project is about finding (and applying) methods to identify anomalies and abnormal observations in production processes. 
Provided with datasets by Daimler AG, the task of the student is to explore the
datasets and their respective structures and based on these insights, 
choose appropriate methods to conduct anomaly analysis, i.e., find (groups of) 
observations that differ significantly from the normal case. 

What is the scope of the project?
=================================

The main focus of this project is to compare different methods and to discuss the advantages and disadvantages
with respect to their theoretical assumptions and their practical implications (e.g., computational costs). 
In this context, it is noteworthy that Daimler AG is interested in applying the methods provided by 
the student to different datasets after the project has been submitted. 
Consequently, reproducibility and setting up a flexible data workflow is a core requirement of the project. 
While guiding literature is provided, the choice of the methods is up to the student. 
Therefore, methods applied can range from traditional econometric time series analysis 
to the application of machine- and deep learning techniques.

Why should I be interested?
===========================

Overall, the project enables the student to learn about the use cases of data 
analysis in a corporate environment and get hands-on experience in professional data science. 
Through supervising meetings with Daimler AG the student has additionally the chance to 
get feedback and insights from professional data scientists and learn about their work. 

How can I apply for the project? 
================================

Given the overall scope of the project previous experience in python is required. 
If you are interested, please (*application process here*).
