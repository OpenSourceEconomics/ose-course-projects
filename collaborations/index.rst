Collaboration projects
======================

We set up collaboration projects with our partners from the private sector. These allow students to directly put the skills acquired during class into action, gain hands-on experience in a professional data science setting, and receive feedback and mentoring from seasoned data scientists. We announce collaboration projects in class and also discuss there how to apply.

Daimler AG
----------

The project is about finding (and applying) methods to identify anomalies and abnormal observations in production processes. Provided with datasets by Daimler AG, the task of the student is to explore the datasets and their respective structures and based on these insights, choose appropriate methods to conduct anomaly analysis, i.e., find (groups of) observations that differ significantly from the normal case.

The main focus of the project is to compare different methods and to discuss the advantages and disadvantages with respect to their theoretical assumptions and their practical implications (e.g., computational costs). In this context, it is noteworthy that Daimler AG is interested in applying the methods provided by the student to different datasets after the project has been submitted. Consequently, reproducibility and setting up a flexible data workflow is a core requirement of the project. While guiding literature is provided, the choice of the methods is up to the student. Therefore, methods applied can range from traditional econometric time series analysis to the application of machine- and deep learning techniques.

Overall, the project enables the student to learn about the use cases of data analysis in a corporate environment and get hands-on experience in professional data science. Through supervising meetings with Daimler AG the student has additionally the chance to get feedback and insights from professional data scientists and learn about their work.

Deutsche Bank
--------------

The Deutsche Bank project uses different modern Machine Learning (ML) methods to detect so-called regret credits, which can be considered as credits that become deficient at some point in time. Initial data sets are provided by Deutsche Bank AG and processed by the student for the final analysis. The student develops appropriate ML models based on the information content of the data set. If necessary, ensemble methods are used to obtain better predictive performance than could be obtained from any of the constituent learning algorithms alone. Moreover, data visualizations are performed to support the result's content to finally present them to the stakeholders.

The projectâ€™s scope is to develop AI-related models that can determine the regret-probability of credits and assign it to certain characteristics. It is programming-heavy and model-oriented, and places a lot of emphasis on the reproducibility of the results, as the AI will be used internally in the long term. One challenge is to shed light on the so-called black-box, where even the AI developers do not know why their AIs make certain decisions. In the light of the project's scope, this means to better understand why the AI assigns a certain probability of being conspicuous to a specific credit. Another challenge is to design the model such that it provides precise results although the data set is imbalanced, that is, it contains many more non-regret credits than regret credits.  

In general, the project would expose the student to research on how to improve classifications with imbalanced datasets, as this type of data can be found in many real-world applications.  Finally, developing an AI-related model facing the issue of explainability is particularly innovative for the banking sector and this allows the student to contribute in a project that aims to apply cutting edge statistical methods. 

Overall, the project enables the student to learn about the use cases of data analysis in a corporate environment and get hands-on experience in professional data science. Through supervising meetings with Daimler AG the student has additionally the chance to get feedback and insights from professional data scientists and learn about their work.
