Collaboration projects
======================

We set up collaboration projects with our partners from the private sector. These allow students to directly put the skills acquired during class into action, gain hands-on experience in a professional data science setting, and receive feedback and mentoring from seasoned data scientists. We announce collaboration projects in class and also discuss there how to apply.

Daimler AG
----------

**What is the project about?**

The project is about finding (and applying) methods to identify anomalies and abnormal observations in production processes. Provided with datasets by Daimler AG, the task of the student is to explore the datasets and their respective structures and based on these insights, choose appropriate methods to conduct anomaly analysis, i.e., find (groups of) observations that differ significantly from the normal case.

**What is the scope of the project?**

The main focus of this project is to compare different methods and to discuss the advantages and disadvantages with respect to their theoretical assumptions and their practical implications (e.g., computational costs). In this context, it is noteworthy that Daimler AG is interested in applying the methods provided by the student to different datasets after the project has been submitted. Consequently, reproducibility and setting up a flexible data workflow is a core requirement of the project. While guiding literature is provided, the choice of the methods is up to the student. Therefore, methods applied can range from traditional econometric time series analysis to the application of machine- and deep learning techniques.

**Why should I be interested?**

Overall, the project enables the student to learn about the use cases of data analysis in a corporate environment and get hands-on experience in professional data science. Through supervising meetings with Daimler AG the student has additionally the chance to get feedback and insights from professional data scientists and learn about their work.



Deutsche Bank AG

**What is the project about?**

<p align="justify">
The project is about using different modern Machine Learning (ML) methods to detect so-called regret credits, which can be considered as credit delinquencies. Each credit is to be assigned a certain probability of deficiency at some point in time. Datasets are provided by Deutsche Bank AG and consist of mortgage credit portfolios. The student's task it to prepare the datasets for the final analysis and to develop adequate models based on the dataset's information content.
If necessary, multiple learning algorithms are used to obtain better predictive performance than could be obtained from any of the constituent learning algorithms alone. These so-called ensemble methods are especially used if certain methods provide better results for specific cases. Moreover, data visualizations are performed to support the content of the data and results to finally present those results to the stakeholders.

**What is the scope of the project?**

<p align="justify">
The projectâ€™s scope is to develop an AI-related model that can determine the probability of credit deficiencies and allocate this probability to certain characteristics (e.g. civil status). Several ML methods will be developed and compared to build the final model based on the performance and precision of the ML accuracy. The project will be very programming-heavy and model-oriented, and places a lot of emphasis on the reproducibility of the results, as the AI will be used internally in the long term. One main challenge is to shed light on the so-called black-box, where even the AI developers do not know why their AIs make certain decisions. The in the scientific community highly debated topic of "explainable AI" will be addressed in the project to better understand why the AI assigns a certain probability of being conspicuous to a specific credit. Another main challenge is that the dataset is imbalanced, that is, it contains many more non-regret credits than regret credits. This has to be taken into account in the model development.

First, it is important to understand how AI comes to certain results. As AI becomes more advanced, humans are challenged to understand their decisions. Explainability can help developers ensure that the system is working as expected, it might be necessary to meet regulatory standards, or it might be important in allowing those affected by a decision to challenge or change that outcome. This explainability is also relevant concerning social issues. For example, there is a well-known scandal in the field of crime risk assessment, in which the COMPAS software was used across the US to predict future criminals. As it appears from this <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing/">article</a>, the software that uses ML is biased against blacks. This could possibly be prevented by increasing the transparency of the so-called black box.

<p align="justify">
Second, it is worthwhile to investigate how classifications with imbalanced datasets can be improved, as imbalanced data can be found in many real-world applications, e.g. cancer detection. And, as mentioned in the paper "Survey on deep learning with class imbalance" written by Johnson and Khoshgoftaar (2019), very little empirical work in the area of deep learning with class imbalance exists although there were recent advances in deep learning, along with its increasing popularity.

Finally, the project enables students to learn about uncertainty and risk quantification using ML methods and the application of highly professional data science in the banking sector. Banks are subject to many guidelines and have to justify lending decisions, so developing such a model coupled with the issue of explainability is particularly innovative and futuristic for the banking sector. From the perspective that ML methods are still rarely used in the banking world, but are commonplace in the Silicon Valley world, this project allows the student to contribute to a potential migration of futuristic methods in the banking world.
